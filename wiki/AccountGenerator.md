## Generation using implemented email APIs (Auto method, but less stable)
> If you use ```--email-api tempmail```, you need to have the cloudflare captcha solved!
> Then you need to press Enter after you see the email site, without fail (**[INPT]** console message type)!

> Also, if you see a message like **[INPT]** in the console, it means that you need to do keyboard input into the console!

1. Run **main.py** or executable file in Console or use [MBCI](MBCI-Inferface.md):
```
python main.py --chrome
```
```
BitdefenderGen_v1.0.0.0_win64.exe --chrome
```
> File name is unique for each version! Do not copy the above command. This is an example!

2. Wait until you will see the account data
> This information will also be written to a file named "Today date - BITDEFENDER ACCOUNTS.txt"
